          <h3>How does the "Share" button work?</h3>
          <p>
            "Share" allows you to select content from this app and send it to another device via email. Recipients will receive an email message with the subject line, "Information has been sent to
            you from SAMHSA Behavioral Health Disaster Response App." Emails contain treatment or other referral information selected, or content from the app with a link to access more information.
          </p>

          <h3>Can I print out information from the SAMHSA Behavioral Health Disaster Response App?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes, but not directly. To enable printing, use the "Share" button to send information by email, open the message on a computer or other printer-enabled device, and print. Or, if you have a
            phone-to-USB cable, you can follow the instructions that came with your phone for transferring files.
          </p>

          <h3>How does application content get updated?</h3>
          <p>
            App content is updated from time to time; The updates happen automatically without having to install a new version from the online marketplace. You must be connected to the Internet in
            order to receive updated content.
