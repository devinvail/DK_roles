ICM evolved from assertive community treatment (ACT) and case management (CM). ICM emphasizes frequent contact, small caseloads (<20 cases) and high intensity of care designed to improve planning for and responsiveness to the consumer's multiple service needs. The case manager coordinates required services from across the mental health system as well as other service systems (e.g., criminal justice, social services) as the consumer's service needs change. Intensive case managers fulfill a vital function for consumers by working with them to realize personal recovery goals and providing the support and resources that the consumer needs to achieve goals, stabilize his/her life and improve his/her quality of life.","serviceCategory":"AS","viewSequence":"18160","saCode":"N","mhCode":"Y","useForSelection":"N","bothCode":"N","serviceTypeCssClassString":" sa-N mh-Y both-N","saBooleanString":"false","mhBooleanString":"true","bothBooleanString":"false"},{"serviceCode":"IMR","serviceName":"Illness management and recovery","serviceDescription":"Uses a standardized individual or group format based on five evidence-based practices: 1) Psychoeducation, 2) Behavioral tailoring, 3) Relapse prevention training, 4) Coping skills training, and 5) Social skills training.","serviceCategory":"AS","viewSequence":"18170","saCode":"N","mhCode":"Y","useForSelection":"N","bothCode":"N","serviceTypeCssClassString":" sa-N mh-Y both-N","saBooleanString":"false","mhBooleanString":"true","bothBooleanString":"false"},{"serviceCode":"IPC","serviceName":"Integrated primary care services","serviceDescription":"Address the general health care needs of persons with mental health and substance use problems.
