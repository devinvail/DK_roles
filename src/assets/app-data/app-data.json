These signs of stress are normal, and may be more likely or pronounced in people with loved ones in parts of the world affected by the outbreak. In the wake of an infectious disease outbreak, monitor your own physical and mental health.</p><b>Know the Signs of Stress</b><p>What follows are behavioral, physical, emotional, and cognitive responses that are all common signs of anxiety and stress. You may notice some of them after you learn about an infectious disease outbreak.</p><b>Your Behavior:</b><ul><li>An increase or decrease in your energy and activity levels</li><li>An increase in your alcohol, tobacco use, or use of illegal drugs</li><li>An increase in irritability, with outbursts of anger and frequent arguing</li><li>Having trouble relaxing or sleeping</li><li>Crying frequently</li><li>Worrying excessively</li><li>Wanting to be alone most of the time</li><li>Blaming other people for everything</li><li>Having difficulty communicating or listening</li><li>Having difficulty giving or accepting help</li><li>Inability to feel pleasure or have fun</li></ul><h3>Talking With Children: Tips for Caregivers, Parents, and Teachers During Infectious Disease Outbreaks</h3><b>What You Should Know</b><p>When children and youth watch news on TV about an infectious disease outbreak, read about it in the news, or overhear others discussing it, they can feel scared, confused, or anxious&#8211;as much as adults. This is true even if they live far from where the outbreak is taking place and are at little to no actual risk of getting sick. Young people react to anxiety and stress differently than adults. Some may react right away; others may show signs that they are having a difficult time much later. As such, adults do not always know when a child needs help.</p><b>Possible Reactions to an Infectious Disease Outbreak</b><p>Many of the reactions noted below are normal when children and youth are handling stress. If any of these behaviors lasts for more than 2 to 4 weeks, or if they suddenly appear later on, then children may need more help coping.</p><b>Preschool Children, 0&#8211;5 Years Old</b><ul><li><b>Infants and Toddlers, 0&#8211;2 years old</b>, cannot understand that something bad in the world is happening, but they know when their caregiver is upset. They may start to show the same emotions as their caregivers, or they may act differently, like crying for no reason or withdrawing from people and not playing with their toys.</li><li><b>Children, 3&#8211;5 years old</b>, may be able to understand the effects of an outbreak. If they are very upset by news of the outbreak, they may have trouble adjusting to change and loss. They may depend on the adults around them to help them feel better.</li></ul><b>Early Childhood to Adolescence, 6&#8211;19 Years Old</b><ul><li><b>Children, 6&#8211;10 years old</b>, may fear going to school and stop spending time with friends. They may have trouble paying attention and do poorly in school overall. Some may become aggressive for no clear reason. Or they may act younger than their age by asking to be fed or dressed by their parent or caregiver.</li><li><b>Youth and Adolescents, 11&#8211;19 years old</b>, go through a lot of physical and emotional changes because of their developmental stage. So it may be even harder for them to cope with the anxiety that may be associated with hearing and reading news of an infectious disease outbreak. Older teens may deny their reactions to themselves and their caregivers. They may respond with a routine &#8220;I&#8217;m okay&#8221; or even silence when they are upset. Or they may complain about physical aches or pains because they cannot identify what is really bothering them motionally. They may also experience some physical symptoms because of anxiety about the outbreak. Some may start arguments at home and/or at school, resisting any structure or authority. They also may engage in risky behaviors such as using alcohol or drugs.</li></ul><h3>Tips for Talking With Children and Youth of Different Age Groups During an Infectious Disease Outbreak</h3><p>A NOTE OF CAUTION! Be careful not to pressure children to talk about an outbreak or join in expressive activities.</p><p>While most children will easily talk about the outbreak, some may become frightened. Some may even feel more anxiety and stress if they talk about it, listen to others talk about it, or look at artwork related to the outbreak. Allow children to remove themselves from these activities, and monitor them for signs of distress.</p><b>Preschool Children, 0&#8211;5 Years Old</b><p>Give these very young children a lot of cuddling and verbal support.</p><ul><li>Get down to their eye level and speak in a calm, gentle voice using words they can understand.</li><li>Tell them that you always care for them and will continue to take care of them so they feel safe.</li><li>Keep normal routines, such as eating dinner together and having a consistent bedtime.</li></ul><b>Early Childhood to Adolescence, 6&#8211;19 Years Old</b><p>Nurture children and youth in this age group:</p><ul><li>Ask your child or the children in your care what worries them and what might help them cope.</li><li>Offer comfort with gentle words, a hug when appropriate, or just being present with them.</li><li>Spend more time with the children than usual, even for a short while.</li><li>If your child is very distressed, excuse him or her from chores for a day or two.</li><li>Support children spending time with friends or having quiet time to write or create art.</li></ul><h3>Talking With Children: Tips for Caregivers, Parents, and Teachers During Infectious Disease Outbreaks</h3><ul><li>Encourage children to participate in recreational activities so they can move around and play with others.</li><li>Address your own anxiety and stress in a healthy way.</li><li>Let children know that you care about them&#8211;spend time doing something special; make sure to check on them in a nonintrusive way.</li><li>Maintain consistent routines, such as completing homework and playing games together.</li></ul><b>When Children, Youth and Parents, Caregivers, or Teachers Need More Help</b><p>In some instances, children may have trouble getting past their responses to an outbreak, particularly if a loved one is living or helping with the response in an area where many people are sick. Consider arranging for the child to talk with a mental health professional to help identify the areas of difficulty.

        "content": "<p id='nc7f5fd045c99cd45'>Children and youth can face emotional strains after a traumatic event such as a car crash or violence. Disasters also may leave them with long-lasting harmful effects. When children experience a trauma, watch it on TV, or overhear others discussing it, they can feel scared, confused, or anxious. Young people react to trauma differently than adults. Some may react right away; others may show signs that they are having a difficult time much later. As such, adults do not always know when a child needs help coping. This tip sheet will help parents, caregivers, and teachers learn some common reactions, respond in a helpful way, and know when to seek support.</p><ul><li><p id='nc7f5fd0472c0e4ed'>Parents, teachers, and other caregivers can help children express their emotions through conversation, writing, drawing, and singing. Most children want to talk about a trauma, so let them. Accept their feelings and tell them it is ok to feel sad, upset, or stressed. Crying is often a way to relieve stress and grief. <i><b>Pay attention and be a good listener.</b></i></p></li><li><p id='nc7f5fd04784aaad7'>Ask your teen and youth you are caring for what they know about the event. What are they hearing in school or seeing on TV? Try to watch news coverage on TV or the Internet with them. And, limit access so they have time away from reminders about the trauma. Don't let talking about the trauma take over the family or classroom discussion for long periods of time. <i><b>Allow them to ask questions.</b></i></p></li><li><p id='nc7f5fd047dd470c1'>Adults can help children and youth see the good that can come out of a trauma. Heroic actions, families and friends who help, and support from people in the community are examples. Children may better cope with a trauma or disaster by helping others. They can write caring letters to those who have been hurt or have lost their homes; they can send thank you notes to people who helped. <i><b>Encourage these kinds of activities.</b></i></p></li><li><p id='nc7f5fd04835e36ab'>If human violence or error caused an event, be careful not to blame a cultural, racial, or ethnic group, or persons with psychiatric disabilities. This may be a good opportunity to talk with children about discrimination and diversity. <i><b>Let children know that they are not to blame when bad things happen.</b></i></p></li><li><p id='nc7f5fd0488e7fc95'>It's ok for children and youth to see adults sad or crying, but try not to show intense emotions. Screaming and hitting or kicking furniture or walls can be scary for children. <i><b>Violence can further frighten children or lead to more trauma.</b></i></p></li><li><p id='nc7f5fd048e71c27f'>Adults can show children and youth how to take care of themselves. If you are in good physical and emotional health, you are more likely to be readily available to support the children you care about. <i><b>Model self-care, set routines, eat healthy meals, get enough sleep, exercise, and take deep breaths to handle stress.</b></i></p></li></ul><p id='nc7f5fd04a498da27'><i><b>A NOTE OF CAUTION! Be careful not to pressure children to talk about a trauma or join in expressive activities. While most children will easily talk about what happened, some may become frightened. Some may even get traumatized again by talking about it, listening to others talk about it, or looking at drawings of the event. Allow children to remove themselves from these activities, and monitor them for signs of distress.</b></i></p><h3>When Children, Youth and Parents, Caregivers, or Teachers Need More Help</h3><p id='nc7f5fd04bc98891d'>In some instances, a child and their family may have trouble getting past a trauma. Parents or caregivers may be afraid to leave a child alone. Teachers may see that a student is upset or seems different. It may be helpful for everyone to work together. Consider talking with a mental health professional to help identify the areas of difficulty. Together, everyone can decide how to help and learn from each other. If a child has lost a loved one, consider working with someone who knows how to support children who are grieving.</p>",

For those who continue to suffer, help is available.</p><h3>What to expect</h3><h3>...in Your Personal Life</h3><p>Anxiety, sadness, and trouble sleeping are the most common responses to traumatic events. Grief may be felt intensely on and off for at least a year if someone has lost a loved one in the event. Everyone has different ways of coping, which can make people act differently than they usually do.</p><h3>...in Your Family Life</h3><p>It takes time to grieve and rebuild individual and family lives. Everyday routines may not return to normal for months, or even years. Disruptions in routine can make life unfamiliar or unpredictable and change everyone’s expectations. Remember that children’s stress may be a reflection of how their parents are handling stress.</p><h3>...in Your Work and Financial Life</h3><p>Workplace routines may change, or businesses may close altogether. Commuting patterns may be disrupted. The stress may lead to poor work performance, and short tempers may surface at the workplace. Those who experience work disruptions may be unable to regain their previous standard of living. Seeking financial assistance to rebuild and repair damages can add to the stress and frustration.</p><h3>What Helps</h3><p>Everyone has different ways of coping, but there are some steps to recovery that are known to help many people. Start by realizing that you survived the disaster or trauma and that life doesn&#8217;t have to stop.</p><ul><li>Talk with someone. Reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or faith leader and talk about how you are doing.</li><li>Move your body. Try deep breathing, gentle stretching, and walking.</li><li>Meditate and listen to music.</li><li>Promote physical care by eating healthy meals, getting enough rest, and drinking plenty of water. Model these behaviors for your family.</li><li>Reestablish routines. Get back to doing the things you would normally do every day. This can help you regain a sense of control and reduce anxiety.</li><li>Know that it&#8217;s okay to celebrate successes in the recovery process and have moments of joy even after a trauma.</li><li>Try not to let thoughts about the disaster or trauma take over your thinking. If you are having difficulty making sense of the trauma or are questioning why this event happened, seek out a mental health professional or, if you prefer, speak with a trusted faith-based or spiritual leader.</li><li>Speak with a financial advisor. Talking with a professional financial advisor may ease your stress and the feeling that you have to manage it alone.</li></ul><h3>Signs That Survivors Need More Help Managing Stress</h3><ul><li>Disorientation or confusion and difficulty communicating thoughts</li><li>Limited attention span and difficulty concentrating</li><li>Overwhelming guilt and self-doubt</li><li>Feelings of hopelessness</li><li>Frequent mood swings or continuous crying</li><li>Reluctance to leave home</li><li>Increased use of illegal drugs, alcohol, or prescription medication</li><li>Worsening of existing medical problems</li></ul><p>If you or a family member experience trouble coping, or these signs continue for more than 2 to 4 weeks, ask for help. Consult a mental health professional, or see these <a href='during/hotlines-contacts.html'>Helpful Resources</a>. In the workplace, you may be able to get assistance from your human resources department.</p>",

        "content": "<p>If you have experienced a disaster such as a hurricane or flood, or other traumatic event such as a car crash, you may have distressing reactions like feeling anxious or afraid. It&#8217;s also pretty common to think about the event often, even if you were not directly affected and especially if you saw it on television. No reactions are wrong or right. Most responses are just normal ways of reacting to the situation.</p><h3>Tips for Coping</h3><h3>Talk About It.</h3><p>One of the most helpful things to do is to connect with others.  Find a peer who will understand and accept your feelings, or a trusted professor, counselor, or faith leader. Call home to talk with your parents or other caregivers. Share your feelings and concerns with them, or visit the Student Health Center for any physical or emotional concerns.</p><h3>Take Care of Yourself.</h3><p>Rest when you need to. Eat healthy meals and snacks when they are available, and drink plenty of water.</p><h3>Give Yourself a Break&#8212;</h3><p>Take breaks from watching news coverage of the event or listening to radio reports.</p><h3>Avoid Using Alcohol, Drugs, and Tobacco.</h3><p>They will not help you deal with stress, especially right after a traumatic event. They usually just make things worse.</p><h3>Get Back to Your Daily Routines.</h3><p>Do the things you would normally do, even if you don&#8217;t feel like it. It&#8217;s a good way to regain a sense of control and help you feel less anxious.</p><h3>Get Involved in Your Community.</h3><p>Engaging in positive activities like group discussions and candlelight vigils can help bring you comfort and promote healing. They also help you realize you are not alone.  Try something you think you&#8217;d like to do. For example, answer hotlines, distribute clothing, or join a food drive.</p><h3>Help Others.</h3><p>If you are trying to help a friend, make sure to listen attentively (for example, avoid looking at your cell phone) to find out where he or she is in the coping process. Others may have different responses from you, so try to accept their feelings. If you are concerned about them, contact one of the resources in this app for help.</p><h3>Remember.</h3><p>If a trauma was caused by a violent act, it is common to be angry at people who have caused great pain.

        "content": "<p>If u were involved in a traumatic event, like a disaster or a shooting, it would b common for u 2 feel some anxiety, fear, sadness, or disconnectedness. If u think ur feelings don’t matter, know that others may b feeling the same. Ur not alone. If uve been doing nothing b/c of the stress of the trauma, here r some tips that might help u feel better.</p><p>Share these txt msgs 2 reach out and connect w/ others:</p><p><strong>Spend Time W/Others and Talk About It.</strong></p><p>This is the #1 way 2 feel better. Some people isolate themselves after a trauma, don&#8217;t want 2 burden others, or just want 2 b alone. A little time to calm urself is ok, but don&#8217;t go it alone. Every1 has different ways of reacting, but most people have a need 2 talk about what happened 2 them. Seek friends, family, classmates, and professors u can talk 2 and w/whom u feel safe. U might find ur stronger after a while.</p><p><strong>Take Care of Yourself.</strong></p><p>This is easy 2 say, but what does it mean? Limit ur exposure 2 the trauma. 4 example, turn off the TV news that shows the events over and over. Rest, exercise, and eat healthy meals. Do things that will relax u and help u to calm urself. Give urself a break from listening 2 every1 else&#8217;s stories by doing something upbeat like listening 2 music.</p><p><strong>Get Back 2 or Develop Routines.</strong></p><p>Having a regular schedule of getting up in the morning and going 2 bed around the same times, and having meals and exercising around the same time every day can really help u 2 feel better. That way ur body learns when it&#8217;s time 2 b alert, when 2 relax, and when 2 expect nourishment. This will help control ur emotions. Talking 2 others can also help u feel less alone. Check in w/family or friends at a scheduled time every day to help you feel better, even if u don&#8217;t notice that ur anxious or upset.</p><p><strong>Move Your Body.</strong></p><p>What happens 2 ur body after a trauma is stress. Stress causes a buildup of chemicals in ur body that first helps u 2 respond in case u need to run or fight. But then u need 2 get those extra chemicals out of ur body. Body movement is a good way 2 do that. Deep breathing that focuses on the exhale is something that ne1 can do A3. Walking is one of the easiest exercises, and gentle stretching like yoga is another very good way 2 move toxic chemicals out of ur body. Try 1 or all 3 of these every day for 20&#8212;30 minutes. Or maybe dance.</p>",

It is a natural part of life.</p><p><b>How does grief feel?</b></p><p>Just after a death or loss, you may feel empty and numb, as if you are in shock. You may notice physical changes such as trembling, nausea, trouble breathing, muscle weakness, dry mouth, or trouble sleeping and eating.</p><p>You may become angry - at a situation, a particular person, or just angry in general. Almost everyone in grief also experiences guilt. Guilt is often expressed as 'I could have, I should have, and I wish I would have' statements.</p><p>People in grief may have strange dreams or nightmares, be absent-minded, withdraw socially, or lack the desire to return to work. While these feelings and behaviors are normal during grief, they will pass.</p><p><b>How long does grief last?</b></p><p>Grief lasts as long as it takes you to accept and learn to live with your loss. For some people, grief lasts a few months. For others, grieving may take years. The length of time spent grieving is different for each person.</p><p><b>How will I know when I'm done grieving?</b></p><p>Every person who experiences a death or other loss must complete a four-step grieving process:</p><ul><li><p>Accept the loss.</p></li><li><p>Work through and feel the physical and emotional pain of grief.</p></li><li><p>Adjust to living in a world without the person or item lost.</p></li><li><p>Move on with life.</p></li></ul><p><b>What if these feelings won't go away?</b></p><p>If you recently experienced a death or other loss, feelings of grief are part of a normal reaction.
